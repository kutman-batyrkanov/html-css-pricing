                                https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent/blob/master/LICENSE</a> (the “Other Software”), 
                            which, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, is licensed to you under those respective licenses and not under the license from BitTorrent, Inc.). 
                            BitTorrent, Inc. reserves all rights in the Software (excluding the Other Software) not expressly granted to you here.</p>

                            <h3>Restrictions</h3>
                            <p>The source code, design, and structure of the Software (excluding the Other Software) are trade secrets.

                            <h3>The BitTorrent Applications</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    <h4>Downloading and Updates</h4>
                                    <p>The BitTorrent and uTorrent software are peer-to-peer file distribution applications distributed by BitTorrent, Inc. (“BitTorrent Applications”).  The  BitTorrent Applications download only those files that are both authorized by you for download (specifically or by category or subscription), except that the Software automatically updates itself.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h4>Automatic Uploading</h4>
                                    <p>The BitTorrent Applications accelerate downloads by enabling your computer to grab pieces of files from other BitTorrent users simultaneously. Your use of the BitTorrent Applications to download files will, in turn, enable other users to download pieces of those files from you, thereby maximizing download speeds for all users. In the BitTorrent Applications, only files that you are explicitly downloading or sharing or have downloaded or shared through BitTorrent Applications will be made available to others. You consent to other users' use of your network connection to download portions of such files from you. At any time, you may uninstall the Software through the Add/Remove Programs control panel utility. In addition, for the BitTorrent Applications, you can control the Software in multiple ways through its user interface without affecting any files you have already downloaded.</p>

                            <h3>Disclaimer of Warranty</h3>
                            <p>BitTorrent, Inc. disclaims any responsibility for harm resulting from the BitTorrent Applications or any software or content downloaded using the Software, whether or not BitTorrent, Inc. approved such software or content. BitTorrent, Inc. approval does not guarantee that software or content from an approved partner will function, sound, or appear as offered or hoped, or be complete, accurate, or free from bugs, errors, viruses, or other harmful content. BitTorrent, Inc expressly disclaims all warranties and conditions, express or implied, including any implied warranties and conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement, and any warranties and conditions arising out of course of dealing or usage of trade regarding the Software or any software or content you download using the BitTorrent Applications. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from BitTorrent, Inc or elsewhere will create any warranty or condition not expressly stated in this agreement. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations on implied warranties, so the above limitation may not apply to you to its full extent.</p>
